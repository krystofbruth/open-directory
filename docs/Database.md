# Database connection

## Overview

Open Active Directory uses the PostgreSQL database to store user details, credentails and other (possibly sensitive) data.

Officially, only the PostgreSQL 17 version is supported. Using lesser versions is possible, but doesn't guarantee the service shall work properly.

Interacting with the database other than through the Open Active Directory server itself is **strongly discouraged**.

##Â Environment variables

Open Active Directory utilizes the following environment variables to connect to the PostgreSQL database. All of them must be set in order for a successful connection to be established.

```
PG-USER
PGPASSWORD
PGHOST
PGPORT
```
